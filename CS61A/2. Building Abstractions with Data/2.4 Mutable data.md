An object can change in value throughout the course of computation. 

```python
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
a = numbers # a is now the same list as numbers (not only equal)
numbers.pop() # [1,2,3]
numbers.append(10) # [1,2,3,10]

> a # Since a is the list stored in number, it mutated as well
[1, 2, 3, 10]

> a == numbers # Checks if the values are equal
True

> a is numbers # Checks if the variables have the same identity
True
```

Mutation can also happen in function calls: 

```python
def remove_last_two(list_argument): 
	list_argument.pop()
	list_argument.pop()
	# Method does not return any new values.
	# It mutates the list passed in as an argument directly!

four = [1, 2, 3, 4]
remove_last_two(four)

> four
[1, 2]
```


## Immutability
Python contains some immutable data types:
- tuples 
- strings
- numbers

These do not express the behaviour shown above.
Some immutable types can contain mutable values within them, that can change. 

## Mutable default arguments
Mutable default arguments are **Very** dangerous!

```python 
# There is only a single list object created here for all function
# calls to f()
def f(s=[]):
	s.append(1)
	retun len(s)

>f()
1
>f()
2
>f()
3
```

Here below we see the environment diagram for this piece of code. 
Each function call uses the default variable s that points to the same list!

## Referential transparency

Expressions are referentially transparent if sustituting an expression with its value does not change the meaning of a program. 

```python
mul(add(2, mul(4,6)), add(3,5)) 
mul (add(2, 24), add(3,5)) # still same
mul( 26, add(3,5)) # still same
mul( 26, 8) # still same
```

Mutation operations violate the condition of referential transparency because they do not only return a new value, but they change the environment.
