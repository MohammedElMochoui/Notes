## Environments
Names are bound to values, which are distributed across many independent local frames, along with a single global frame that contains shared names. A new local frame is introduced every time a function is called.

## Functions as Abstractions
We can use functions as abstractions to actions, without knowing the implementation. We only concern us about: 
- **Domain**: The set of arguments it can take.
- **Range:** The set of values it can return.
- **Intent:** The relationship it computes between the input and the output (and the side effects it generates). 

Example for **squares()**: 
- Domain -> Single real number
- Range -> Non-negative real number
- Intent -> Square of the input
