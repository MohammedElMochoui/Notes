## Functions as Arguments

Consider the following three functions:

```python
def sum_naturals(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return tota
```

```python
def sum_cubes(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k*k*k, k + 1
        return total
```

```python
def pi_sum(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + 8 / ((4*k-3) * (4*k-1)), k + 1
        return total
```

These three functions clearly share a common underlying pattern. They are for the most part identical, differing only in name and the function of k used to compute the term to be added. Each of these functions is a summation of terms. 

We can abstract this to a Higher Order Function: 

```python
def summation(n, term):
	"""
	This function can abstract the above three functions by passing
	the correct term as a function in the second parameter.
	"""
	total, k = 0, 1
	while k <= n: 
		total, k = total + term(k), k+1 
	return total

def cube(x):
	return x * x * x

def sum_cubes(n): 
	return summation(n, cubes)
```
