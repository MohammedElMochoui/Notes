## Statements vs Expressions
The Python programming language consists of expressions and statements: 
- Expressions: an instruction that _combines values and operators_ and _always evaluates down to a single value_.
```python
"Hello" # String expression
5 # Number expression
5*5+12-1 # Also a number expression
```

- Statements: Python instruction that does not evaluate down to a value. A Python statement is pretty much everything else that isn't an expression.
```Python
foo = "Hello" # Statement (variable assignment)
```

Expressions are evaluated, statements are executed. 
Statements govern the relationship among different expressions in a program and what happens to their results.

## Python evaluation
Python evaluates nested call expressions recursively.

Python starts evaluating the terminal nodes and climbs up the tree untill it reaches the top node, after which the evaluation has completed. 

## Pure vs Non-pure functions
- Pure functions are functions without side effects.

- Non-pure functions have side effects.
